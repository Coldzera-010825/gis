# GeoData Toolkit ðŸš€

A growing collection of **Python utilities for geospatial data processing, analysis, and visualisation**.  
The goal is to keep each script **self-contained** and **easy to reuse** in day-to-day GIS workflows, whether you are a data scientist, cartographer, or researcher.

## âœ¨ What you can do with this repo

| Category | Capabilities (present & planned) |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **Data processing** | â€¢ Batch convert between vector/raster formats (e.g. `shp â†’ tif`, `shp â†” kml`) <br>â€¢ Coordinate-system transformations <br>â€¢ CRUD operations on attribute tables |
| **Data analysis**   | â€¢ Spatial joins & overlays <br>â€¢ Zonal statistics <br>â€¢ Terrain & hydrological analysis (road-mapped) |
| **Visualisation**   | â€¢ Quick-look PNG generation for QA <br>â€¢ Matplotlib-based thematic maps (planned) |

> **Status:** _active development_ â€“ scripts are added & refined continuously.  
> Pull Requests and feature ideas are welcome!

## ðŸ“‚ Current script list

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scripts/kml_ouput` | Create a user-defined **bounding rectangle** (by centre + size / by lat-lon extent) and save it as **KML**.  Optional flags let you export the same rectangle as Shapefile or GeoJSON. |
| `scripts/shp2tif_workflow` | Generic **Shapefile â†’ GeoTIFF** converter â€“ supports geometry repair, size limits, float-32 attribute rasterisation (e.g. `DEPTH2D`). |
| `notebooks/batch_coordinate_transform.ipynb` | **Batch re-projection utility**: recursively scans a folder, assigns a CRS if missing, and converts all vector layers to **WGS-84 (EPSG 4326)**. Supports Shapefile / GeoJSON / GPKG; writes a mirrored directory tree under `output_root/`. |

Planned additions (ðŸ“… Q3 2025):

* `scripts/clip_by_polygon` â€“ vector & raster clipping
* `notebooks/analysis_templates/` â€“ ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks for common analyses
